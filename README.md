# How to Cheat Using a FX-991EX Calculator

The FX-991EX calculator, a popular model among enthusiasts and hobbyists, offers a unique feature that allows users to bypass its limitations and access a hidden spreadsheet function. This guide will walk you through the process of accessing and utilizing this feature, which can be considered a "cheat" by some. However, it's important to note that this method is not endorsed by the manufacturer and should be used responsibly.

## Accessing the Unresetable Spreadsheet

1. **Turn on the calculator** by pressing the ON button.
2. **Navigate to the Menu Spreadsheet function** by pressing Shift + 8. This will open a spreadsheet that cannot be reset using the usual methods.

### Important Note

- The spreadsheet can only be reset by turning off the calculator and then turning it back on or simply turning it on. Pressing Shift + AC will not reset the spreadsheet; it might only clear the data currently displayed on the screen.

## Cheating with the Spreadsheet

To cheat, or more accurately, to use the spreadsheet for purposes not intended by the manufacturer, follow these steps:

1. **Choose a cell** in the spreadsheet where you want to input your formula.
2. **Type in the equals sign (=)** before typing in any other formula. This will usually result in a syntax error, but you can ignore that.
3. After typing the equals sign, the cell will display an "ERR" message, but if you hover over the cell, you will see the formula you typed.

### Letters Available

- **Already available**: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, k, n, p, t, u, x, y
- **Restricted** (View the first letter): L (as lp), O (as Î´), V (as Vm), and Z (as zo)
- **Unavailable**: I, J, Q, S, W

### Replacements for Unavailable Letters

- **I** can be replaced with **1**
- **J** can be replaced with **KJ**
- **Q** can be replaced with **0.**
- **S** can be replaced with **5**
- **W** can be replaced with **uu**

## Finding Letters

You can find additional letters in the following menus:

1. **OPTN Menu** then number 3
2. **The preset variable** ABCDEF as well as x and y and the Memory M
3. **(Shift Multiplication or division)** which gives the letters P and C
4. **(Shift + 7)** which gives a preset constants tab

## Conclusion

While this method allows for a creative use of the FX-991EX calculator, it's important to remember that it's not a feature intended for everyday use. The calculator's primary purpose is to perform mathematical calculations, and using it in ways not intended by the manufacturer can lead to unexpected results or damage to the device. Always use such methods responsibly and consider the potential consequences.
